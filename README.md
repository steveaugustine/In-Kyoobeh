# Present.io


Present.io is a attendance taking app that revolutionalizes the attendance taking process.
Usually the process of taking attendance in a classroom/event is a time consuming and cumbersome process.
Our app solves this problem by asking all users to connect to the local wifi of the class/event and tapping the cube on their Present.io app.

Present.io uses wifimanager to access the current wifi of the user and stores it in a firebase realtime database.
The user is allowed to filter out the wifi name/classname they wish to access.
On tapping the hovering cube they get a list of all attendees.
